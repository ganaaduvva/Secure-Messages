# Secure-Messages

Secure Messages is completely a command-line interface where the user on the console has to type the message and encode the message by simply using a key the key on the other hand can be used to decode the message. The core security has been provided by the principle of Caesar-Cipher 

Caesar-Cipher is an ancient method of securing the message with a shift key. The shift key on encoding the text results in message to shift to right according to shift number provided on encoding

The text which has been encoded passed to another person and on the other hand they decode the message with the same shift key to decrypt message for readability

Unless the person know the Shift Key they can't read message

* Encryption can be done by:
1. Typing the message
2. Encoding with Shift Key
That result the encrypted text to send

* Decryption can be done by:
1. Writing the encrypted text on console
2. Decoding with same Shift Key provided on another end
That result in decrypted message to read
